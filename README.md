## Why?

While trying to beef up my Cyber Security chops through CTFs I started learning a bit of x86 assembly language and decided I wanted to learn more. Combining computer architecture and assembly should make it easier to learn both and will serve as a jumping off point for topics like operating system innards that I will encounter at some point. 

Also because it will help me get better at working with abstractions. The same mental tricks that I will use to get a 'working' system out of a collection of gates will work when I am designing a network or troubleshooting a collection of micro-services.

Like a lot of people with a technical bent it bothers me when I need to abstract away lower levels. While studying basic computer architecture is probably not the best way to get a job in network or system administration, it will make me more effective and more confident when working with computer technology. Also it is a nice break from learning network admin and devOps related skills.  

(So basically for fun)

## How?

So unless you are working with the same tools (i.e doing some variation of this course/project) I doubt the HDL specifications files will be of much use. While I do hope to write something more interesting than a version of tetris on the Hack platform until I get to that point I don't have any instructions on how to run, or make use of any of this...
